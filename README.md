# bm40_layout
My bm40 keyboard layout ðŸ˜„

## Introduction
Inspired by
[benballack](https://configure.zsa.io/planck-ez/layouts/4D3ym/jYYjx/0), but this
is for [bm40rgbhs](https://kprepublic.com/products/bm40-rgb-40-hot-swap-custom-mechanical-keyboard-pcb-qmk-underglow-type-c-planck)

Idea from [My 36 Key Layout Works BEAUTIFULLY on the Planck
EZ!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv98LPMA7-M). But I just need 34 keys, so I make my own base on this.

This layout is only for MacOS user, especially for using vim and tmux!

Detailed layout is [here](https://configure.zsa.io/planck-ez/layouts/ExmJ6/latest/2)

## Final
I will keep this updated. Hope this will inspired you. Especially YOU who are
reading this README! Thanks!
